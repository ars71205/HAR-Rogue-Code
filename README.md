# HAR-Rogue-Code

# Human Activity Recognition (HAR) System using LSTM

This project is a **Human Activity Recognition (HAR) model** built using the **UCI HAR Dataset**.  
It classifies **six human fitness activities** based on time-series smartphone sensor data collected from 30 individuals.  
The aim of this project is to understand and implement a **multi-class classification** problem using Deep Learning (LSTM).

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

The model uses **9-channel inertial sensor data** (accelerometer & gyroscope) to recognize the following activities:

| Label | Activity |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | WALKING |
| 1 | WALKING_UPSTAIRS |
| 2 | WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS |
| 3 | SITTING |
| 4 | STANDING |
| 5 | LAYING |
